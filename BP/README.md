The models can be run through src/main.py. It does require src to be designated as a source folder in the project. In
PyCharm, this can be done by navigating to File > Settings > Project: BP > Project Structure, highlighting src and marking
it as a source folder. If it is unclear how to mark a folder as a source folder in your IDE, you may move all files from
src to the root (BP) folder, and adjust imports and filepaths. I will most likely update the code to omit the src folder altogether
later down the line. Apologies for the inconvenience.
